This is a very simple python starter script to automate a series of PWSCF
calAllations. If you don't know Python, get a quick primer from the official
Python doAlmentation at https://docs.python.org/2.7/. The script is deliberately
simple so that only basic Python syntax is used and you can get comfortable with
making changes and writing programs.
